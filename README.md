# Financial Data Analysis and Stock Market Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing financial data and predicting stock market trends using machine learning models. The goal is to build a predictive model that can help in making informed investment decisions.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the financial datasets used for analysis and model training.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
- `reports/`: Generated analysis reports and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

Create the structure with the following commands

For Ubuntu
```
mkdir -p project/{data,notebooks,src,models,reports,config,scripts,logs} &&
touch project/{README.md,config/api_keys.yaml,config/params.json,scripts/fetch_data.py,scripts/train_model.py,logs/training.log}
```

For Windows
```
mkdir project; cd project;
mkdir data, notebooks, src, models, reports, config, scripts, logs;
New-Item README.md -ItemType File;
New-Item config\api_keys.yaml -ItemType File;
New-Item config\params.json -ItemType File;
New-Item scripts\fetch_data.py -ItemType File;
New-Item scripts\train_model.py -ItemType File;
New-Item logs\training.log -ItemType File;

```

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

### Create a Virtual Environment

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Add to `.gitignore`

To ensure the virtual environment is not tracked by Git, add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

```
venv/
```

## Usage

1. Activate the virtual environment as described above.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and develop models.
3. Use the scripts in the `src/` directory to preprocess data, train models, and make predictions.
